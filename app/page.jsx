        I am an aspiring web developer who is passionate and curious to learn
        and explore new things in this field of web development. Currently
        pursuing my BE in AI and ML, beyond my technical interests I'm an
        aviation enthusiast and automotive enthusiast who gets fascinated by
        seeing these beautiful machines. I enjoy clicking the pictures of nature
        when it shows its best form!!
